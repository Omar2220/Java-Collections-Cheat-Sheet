# Java-Collections-Cheat-Sheet

** Java Collections Cheat Sheet Is Served! **

I love to code using Java language due to a lot of reasons, but mainly it's because:

1-Java is platform-independent(meaning it can almost run on any OS).  

2-Java can serve a variety of purposes(mobile apps, web apps, cloud apps, etc).

3-Java has an abundant Application Programming Interface (API)that includes many Java classes, packages, interfaces, etc. 

Recently I was developing a tasty program but didn't find a good collections cheat sheet that combines all the specs that a developer/programmer
would be interested in at one place, so I've decided to go for it and deliver this cool solution, maybe another developer had 
the same problem, hope it'll be useful for you folks, share and enjoy!

excuse me for any mistakes, after all, every program has a bug, so any additions will be welcomed ;)
